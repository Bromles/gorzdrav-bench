# NodeJS version

How to run:

- Install NodeJS. I personally recommend using Node Version Manager:
  - [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for Windows
  - [original nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Linux/macOS
- Run benchmark:
  - Windows with PowerShell: `.\measure.ps1`
  - macOS/Linux: `./measure.sh`

How to clean after running:

- Delete the `mockData` folder
